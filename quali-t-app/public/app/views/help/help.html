    <h4>Quality Attributes, Catalogs, Projects?</h4>
    <div>Before you can benefit from QUALI-T you must understand the key models of the application. There are <b>5</b>
      of
      them:<br><br>

        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Quality Attribute Template (QA Template)</td>
          <td>
            Create templates for quality attributes, which can be then used while creating of a new project.
            The big advantage of templates is the option to add variables.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Catalog</td>
          <td>
            Group multiple quality attribute templates into one catalog and re-use the catalog for creating new
            projects.
            Every project of the same catalog has automatically all quality attribute templates inside.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Project</td>
          <td>
            This is the most important element in QUALI-T, because it is the original intention of the software.
            Specify quality attributes for the project you are working on. A project consists of a set of quality
            attributes instances.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Quality Attribute Instance (QA)</td>
          <td>
            Quality Attribute Instances live inside projects. After creating the project based on a catalog, each of the
            quality attribute template gets an instance.
            The instance is now decoupled from the catalog and can be edited. The user wants typically to change values
            of
            the variables, change quality property states or
            export to Issue Tracking System (JIRA).
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Quality Properties (QP)</td>
          <td>
            Quality Properties are useful for measuring some specific properties of a quality attribute. QP's are
            boolean
            values
            and can either be satisfied or not. An example could be <b>S - Specific</b>. Each quality attribute has a
            checkbox
            next to it.
            If the quality property is specific, the checkbox could be checked. This means that the <b>S - Specific</b>
            quality
            property is satisfied.
